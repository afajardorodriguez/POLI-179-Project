# POLI-179-Project

**Overview**
Our project aims to analyze the oral arguments presented during Supreme Court cases and explore the relationship between justices' rhetoric, sentiment, and voting patterns. 

**Research Question:** We hypothesize that the verbal exchanges during oral arguments contain valuable indicators of justices' sequential positions and voting tendencies.

In order to test this, we provide the necessary data and replication code here. 


**Data**: 
This directory contains raw and cleaned data in which can also be found in Convokit toolkit. 

**Notebooks**: 
This directory hosts Jupyter notebooks used for analysis, visualization, and interpretation of results. Contains data used in the project. 

**Figures**: 
This directory contains all figures generated during analysis, including plots, charts, and visualizations.
